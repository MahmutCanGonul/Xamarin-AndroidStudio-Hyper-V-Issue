Solution:

💣Hyper-V is another Virtualisation technique just like Intel HAXM. You cannot use both at the same time. Hence, It is necessary to Disable Hyper-V. You can follow these steps to disable Hyper-V 

▶️Go to Control Panel -> Programs and Features -> Turn Windows features on or off

▶️From the window disable Hyper-V options

▶️Reboot your machine
